**Case Study: Advanced Malware Detection System**

**1. Problem Definition:**
Malware can be hidden inside various file formats, including `.txt`, `.exe`, `.js`, `.bat`, `.py`, and other executable/script files. Attackers use techniques like:
- Embedding malicious code inside `.txt` files, which can later be executed.
- Encoding malware using Base64, XOR, or ROT13 to bypass security checks.
- Using `.txt` files as payload carriers, which other scripts execute.
- Tricking users into renaming `.txt` files to `.exe`, `.bat`, or `.py`.

The challenge is to **detect and prevent** execution of such malware, even if hidden or encoded.

**2. Attack Scenarios:**
1. **Social Engineering:** Attacker tricks the victim into renaming and executing a `.txt` file.
2. **Encoded Malware:** The `.txt` file contains Base64-encoded commands that a script decodes and executes.
3. **Auto-Execution:** Another script reads and executes the `.txt` file (e.g., `exec(open('malware.txt').read())`).
4. **Malicious Scripts:** `.exe`, `.bat`, `.js`, and `.py` files contain direct malware commands.
5. **Windows Double Extension Trick:** `malware.txt.exe` appears as a `.txt` but runs as an `.exe`.

---

**3. Our Approach to Solving the Problem:**
We will create a **multi-layered malware detection system** that:
- Scans `.txt` files for **encoded, obfuscated, or suspicious commands**.
- Detects direct **malware patterns in `.exe`, `.js`, `.bat`, `.py`** files.
- Identifies if a `.txt` file **is referenced for execution by another script**.
- Monitors file **renaming attempts** to prevent `.txt` â†’ `.exe` conversions.
- Auto-moves suspicious `.txt` files to a **Quarantine folder**.

---

**4. Implementation Plan:**
1. **Malware Signature Database:**
   - Store known malware patterns (e.g., `os.system("rm -rf /")`, `powershell -exec`).
   - Update signatures regularly to detect new threats.

2. **Scanning System:**
   - Read each file and compare against **malware signatures**.
   - Detect encoded malware (Base64, XOR, ROT13) inside `.txt`.
   - Identify obfuscation tricks (e.g., `e*v*a*l()`).

3. **Real-Time File Monitoring:**
   - Watch the **Downloads folder** for new `.txt`, `.exe`, `.bat`, and `.js` files.
   - Auto-move suspicious files to a **Quarantine folder**.

4. **Behavioral Analysis:**
   - Detect if a `.txt` file is being **executed by another script**.
   - Identify if a user is **renaming `.txt` to an executable format**.

---

**5. Expected Outcome:**
By implementing this, we will:
âœ” Detect malware hidden inside `.txt`, `.exe`, `.js`, `.bat`, `.py` files.
âœ” Prevent execution of `.txt`-based malware payloads.
âœ” Block encoded and obfuscated threats before execution.
âœ” Provide **real-time monitoring** of file activity to stop suspicious behavior.

This case study will demonstrate a **unique approach** to malware detection, going beyond traditional antivirus methods by focusing on **hidden and encoded threats**.

**Next Steps:**
- Assign team roles for implementation.
- Collect and test malware signature samples.
- Build an initial prototype for scanning files.
